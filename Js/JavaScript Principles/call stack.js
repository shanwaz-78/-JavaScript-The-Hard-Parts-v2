// Call Stack:-

// When we exicute a function at that time whatever fucntions are made that are stored in call stack and it will again create a creation face (memory locate) & code execution face and work in the same way as we talked before;

// JavaScript keeps track of what function is currently running[where's the thread of execution];

// Run a function-add to call stack

//Finish running the function-JS removes it form call stack.

// Whatever is top of the call stack:- that's the function we're currently running.
